Assembly Instructions:

All models are in the Models folder

Create a sensor or battery module for left or right ear using an appopriate base and top part. For example:
sensorBaseLeft.stl plus sensorTop.stl are for a left sensor earbud
powerBaseRight.stl plus powerTop.stl are for a right power earbud

The battery unit clicks shut. The sensor unit should be secured with M1 bolts (10mm) and nuts. 

Screw the appropriate earLoop (left or right) to the loopToBaseConnector with an M2 bolt (8-12mm) and nut. The nut is in the connector. 

Slide the connector onto the sensor or battery base (it will be very stiff). 

Push the outerEarStrut into the hole on the earLoop and fit a rubber earbud over it.
